[![Compile](https://vsrm.dev.azure.com/neuropoly/_apis/public/Release/badge/46799180-12b7-4319-b8e7-94e1d39047e7/3/10)](https://dev.azure.com/neuropoly/qMRLab/_release?view=mine&_a=releases&definitionId=3)

## Purpose 

The notebooks in this repository are automatically generated by qMRLab using Azure Release `documentation` pipeline stage `Build and push notebooks`. The base Docker image associated with this repo's Binder build (`qmrlab/octjn:latest`) is built and pushed to DockerHub by the Azure `qMRLab Release Pipeline` upon every qMRLab release.

Each documentation page will be inserted a Binder badge pointing to the notebook address in a BinderHub session by Azure Release `documentation` pipeline stage `GenPushDocs`.
